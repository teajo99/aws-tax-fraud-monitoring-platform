# HMRC Fraud Intelligence Platform (AWS EC2 + Linux + Flask + NGINX)

## Overview

This project is a cloud-based fraud intelligence and monitoring system deployed on AWS EC2 using Linux, Flask, and NGINX.

It simulates a government-grade HMRC tax fraud detection platform that processes fraud risk data through a backend API and displays a real-time monitoring dashboard.
